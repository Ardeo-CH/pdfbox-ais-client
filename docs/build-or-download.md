# Build or download the client
To get the binary package of the AIS client library, you can either build it
yourself or download it from the Release section of this repository.

There are 2 packages available:

- the client JAR file, containing only the binary files of the client. The dependencies
  are bundled in the same package, but in a different folder.
- the full JAR file, containing all the needed binary files (dependencies included). This one
  is the easiest one to use for the command line use case
