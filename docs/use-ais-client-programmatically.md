# Usage as a Java library
The client library can be used as a normal project dependency, allowing your project to access
the document signing and timestamping features provided by the AIS service.

For Maven projects, add the following in your _POM_ file:
```xml
TODO
```

For Gradle projects, add the following in your _build.gradle_ file:
```groovy
TODO
```

Then use the classes from the _com.swisscom.ais.client_ package for
signing and timestamping PDF documents.

See the sample files in _src/main/java/com/swisscom/ais_ for more information
on how to use this code programmatically.
